/*
 * lsp_resolve.h — Shared LSP-override resolver for the call-edge pipeline.
 *
 * Both pipeline paths (sequential cbm_pipeline_pass_calls and parallel
 * cbm_parallel_extract → resolve_file_calls) need to look up an
 * LSP-resolved call for a given (caller, callee) pair before falling back
 * to the registry's name-based resolver. Before this header existed, each
 * pipeline carried its own copy of that lookup with divergent confidence
 * floors and slightly different match semantics — most production
 * indexing went through the parallel path with a 0.5 floor while the
 * sequential path used 0.6, so the same project produced different
 * CALLS-edge attributions depending on which pipeline mode kicked in.
 *
 * Centralising the lookup here means both pipelines admit exactly the
 * same set of LSP overrides. Each pipeline still owns its own edge
 * emission (sequential uses emit_classified_edge, parallel uses
 * emit_service_edge) — this header only does the matching.
 *
 * Inline-only: no .c file needed.
